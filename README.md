# Uncommon Dart Bug: Inadequate JSON Decoding and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Dart code involving asynchronous operations and JSON response processing.  The provided `bug.dart` showcases improper error handling and inflexible JSON decoding, while `bugSolution.dart` offers a robust alternative.

The original code lacks proper error handling and makes assumptions about the JSON structure, which can lead to runtime exceptions and unexpected behavior. The solution improves error handling and uses more resilient JSON parsing techniques to increase the code's robustness.
